					<span class="comments"># Dear Su Su, when you see this letter, we have been together for 696 days.</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># Actually, I have always had the habit of keeping records, but that's in my diary, where you are almost present every day.</span><br />
					i = Boy(<a href="https://yxzi.xyz/posts/52000/" class="string" target="_blank">"猪猪"</a>);<br />
					u = Girl(<a href="./love.html" class="string" target="_blank">"苏苏"</a>);<br />
					<span class="comments"># First of all, let me apologize. I'm sorry that I don't have much time to play with you and enjoy life right now. I'm sorry for you, Su Su. </span><br />
					<span class="comments"># I have no Money, no time, and I together, really wronged my family Su Su.</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># However, I will try to make our life better, you rest assured, you know, I need time, is not the beginning of the headwind, it is not can not turn over the headwind, life, but is a game, dry is finished.</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># You silly, always like to think about what will happen to us, what a fool! Aren't you worried?</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># I just want to tell you, enjoy the moment, for the future, I am full of confidence, although not rich, but at least not like this.</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># And you don't have to worry about me, because I'm happier now than I've ever been, because I'm getting rid of my family of origin and my vision for our future.</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># Although we will still quarrel from time to time, but the problem is not big, after all, people are emotional, big deal to fight each other (you hit me) After all, there is an old saying called: play is kiss scold is love is hahaha.</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># You have to remember our code "Whoosh", I said, you can't beat me ha, refuse domestic violence, start from Su Su!</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># Recently, thank you very much for your care, otherwise I am estimated to fall in the school, silly buy a house, the day can wait!</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># I can feel that our relationship is on a higher level, although I don't know why, in short, I am beginning to feel happy.</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># Besides, how could I possibly feel bad about Han, when Han is a perfect Han? Every time we quarrel, you will say how you are, I will not think like that. Ok, but this is also my problem, I did not let Han have enough security, I will try to correct it in the future!</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># Those people around you ah, one is not feeling good, ah, I am still afraid you are affected, after all, you are too silly, then I will send you a word good, I hope you can remember!</span><br />
					<strong>Novelty is not to experience the same life with different people, but to explore the unknown world with the same people.</strong><br />
					<span class="comments"># Remember! This is a regular sample test ha, huh!</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># Honestly, I feel lucky to have met you, so don't be proud.</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># Sometimes, I don't want to be reasonable with you, but a lot of times I can't control to be reasonable with you, maybe this is out of control in feelings, just like I sometimes can't control to kiss you "obscene smile".</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># Su Su you ah, sometimes so cute, I love you!</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># I used to do everything is basically a person, lonely used to, but since you, I just know, life can be so colorful, you make my life, and complete a lot, do not know how to repay the silly, it seems that I can only with the body!</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># "The other party has initiated an application to be together forever", please choose one of two:</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># A：Su Su accept</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># B：Han refuses and transfers $999,999,999 trillion to Zhu Zhu.</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># You don't look at me soaking in the library all day, in fact, I am a dish, but it is because of the dish, I must go to the library every day, otherwise, no volume but others!</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># The last generation can't beat it. It's up to our generation. Go!</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># Han rest assured, now can not afford to buy things, I will definitely make up for you later, do not worry ha, first pass a four-level graduation, and then try to test a research, can not be on, all rely on God! Come on, go!</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># I am also a human being, right? Han will also make mistakes, so I hope Han adults have a lot of them, including my little brother in the future.</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># In fact, it is almost said, the writing is too bad, please forgive me, will read it.</span><br />
					<span class="comments"># There is no turning back to the past, and the rest of my life needs advice.</span><br />
